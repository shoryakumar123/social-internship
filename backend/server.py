**Definition:** A fungal infection (mycosis) occurs when a harmful fungus invades the body, often affecting the skin, nails, or mucous membranes.

**Causes:**
- Exposure to pathogenic fungi (dermatophytes, Candida, Aspergillus)
- Warm, moist environments
- Contact with infected people, animals, or soil

**Risk Factors:** Weakened immune system, diabetes, antibiotics use, poor hygiene, sweating

**Symptoms:** Itching, skin rash, red/scaly patches, nodal skin eruptions, ring-shaped lesions

**Treatment:**
- Antifungal creams or ointments (clotrimazole, miconazole) for skin infections
- Oral antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole) for severe cases
- Keep affected area clean and dry

**Prevention:** Keep skin dry, wear breathable clothing, avoid sharing personal items, maintain good hygiene

**Prognosis:** Most fungal infections resolve completely with proper treatment within 2–4 weeks.
